    <h1>Total amount of points</h1>

    <p>Our football team has finished the championship.</p>
    <p>Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.</p>
    <p>For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]</p>

    <p>Points are awarded for each match as follows:</p>
    <p>if x > y: 3 points (win)</p>
    <p>if x < y: 0 points (loss)</p>
    <p>if x = y: 1 point (tie)</p>

    <p>We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.</p>
    
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <p>our team always plays 10 matches in the championship</p>
    <p>0 <= x <= 4</p>
    <p>0 <= y <= 4</p>

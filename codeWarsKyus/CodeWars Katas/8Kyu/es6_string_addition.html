    <h1>ES6 string addition</h1>

    <p>It is easy to join two strings together like this string1 + string2.</p>
    <p>Another way to get the desired result would be with string1.concat(string2)</p>
    <p>ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.</p>
    <p>+ , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!</p>
    <p>If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.</p>

    <script>
        function joinStrings(string1, string2){
            return `${string1} ${string2}`;
        }
    </script>

		<h1>Take the Derivative</h1>
		<p>This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent.</p>
		<p>Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. Then, it has to print out an expression (like 28x^7). "^1" should not be truncated when exponent = 2.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>derive(7, 8)</p>
        <p>In this case, the function should multiply 7 and 8, and then subtract 1 from 8. It should output "56x^7", the first number 56 being the product of the two numbers, and the second number being the exponent minus 1.</p>
        <p>derive(7, 8) --> this should output "56x^7" </p>
        <p>derive(5, 9) --> this should output "45x^8" </p>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <p>The output of this function should be a string</p>
        <p>The exponent will never be 1, and neither number will ever be 0</p>

		<h1>Find the first non-consecutive number</h1>
		<p>Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.</p>

		<p>By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.</p>

		<p>E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.</p>

		<p>If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.</p>

		<p>The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!</p>

   					if(arr[i] - 1 != arr[i-1]){
      					return arr[i];
    				}
  				}
  				return null;

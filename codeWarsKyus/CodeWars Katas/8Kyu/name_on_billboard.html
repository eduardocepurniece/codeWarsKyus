    <h1>Stringy Strings</h1>

    <p>You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. Each character has a default price of £30, but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1 (allways 2 for Java).</p>
    <p>You can not use multiplier "*" operator.</p>
    <p>If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost £600. 20 leters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a character).</p>

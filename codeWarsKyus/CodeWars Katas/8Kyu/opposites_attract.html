		<h1>Opposites Attract</h1>
		<p>Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.</p>
		<p>Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.</p>

		<script>
			function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
                if((flower1 + flower2) % 2 === 1){
                    return true;
                }

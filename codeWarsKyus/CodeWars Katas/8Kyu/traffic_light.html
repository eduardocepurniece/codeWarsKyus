	<h1>Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light</h1>
        <p>You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.</p>
	<p>Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.</p>
	<p>For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.</p>
    </body>
    <script>
	function updateLight(current) {
  	    if(current === 'green'){
    	       	return 'yellow';
  	    } else if(current === 'yellow'){
    		return 'red';
  	    } else if(current === 'red'){
    		return 'green';
  	    }
	}

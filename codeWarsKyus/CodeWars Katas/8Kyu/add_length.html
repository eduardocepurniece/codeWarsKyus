		<h1>Add Length</h1>
		<p>What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?</p>
        <p>Example(Input --> Output)</p>
        <p>"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]</p>
        <p>"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]</p>
        <p>Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .</p>
        <p>Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.</p>

		<h1>Bouncing Balls</h1>
		<p>A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor above ground level, h, is known.</p>
        <p>He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).</p>
        <p>His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.</p>
        <p>How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?</p>
        <p>Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:</p>
        <p>Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0</p>
        <p>Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1</p>
        <p>Float parameter "window" must be less than h.</p>
        <p>If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.</p>
        <p>Note:</p>
        <p>The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window parameter.</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <p>- h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3</p>
        <p>- h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 </p>
        <p>(Condition 2) not fulfilled).</p>

                let times = 0;
                while(window < h){
                    times +=2;
                    h = h*bounce;

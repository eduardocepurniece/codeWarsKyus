		<h1>Printer Errors</h1>
		<p>In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.</p>
        <p>The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...</p>
        <p>Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.</p>
        <p>You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.</p>
        <p>The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <p>s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"</p>
        <p>printer_error(s) => "0/14"</p>
        <p>s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"</p>
        <p>printer_error(s) => "8/22"</p>

			function printerError(s) {
                let colors = 'abcdefghijklm'
                let boxes = s.split('');
                let rate = 0;
                boxes.forEach(x => {
                    if(!colors.includes(x)){
                        rate += 1;
                    }
                });
                return `${rate}/${s.length}`;
            }
